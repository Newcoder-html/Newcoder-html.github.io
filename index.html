<h2 id="first">My first poem</h2>
<p id="f2">The expected blows never land<br>
both the ones I had prepared to throw and the ones I braced for<br>
All I think dismissed with a single remark<br>
And yet I cant fight back for to do so would only make my black wool darker<br>
My thoughts no longer my own<br>
And as I see them descend deeper into the dark void with each tragedy<br>
I wish I could take their hand and stop them
but to do that only hastens their misrable walk<br>
and as they claw for me to return there's no where I can go no where I can run<br>
So I'll wait here just on the edge both ready to fight and resigned to never again raising my fists</p>
<h2 id="second">My second poem</h2><p id="s2">only one true way for it all to end<br>
one way out<br>
and yet many ways for it to come<br>
but do I run toward it in shame<br>
or run away in fear<br>
as soon as I see it nearby jump up to my feet<br>
but after I have made my escape I wonder if I should have let it envelup me its its releasing grasp<br>
is it so wrong of me to think such things<br>
is it so wrong of us all to always shun it<br>
I just dont<br>
I just cant<br>
I just wont<br>
figure it out</p>
    
        
        <h2 id="p">My latast poem</h2>
        <p id="p2">purgatory<br>
is it real<br>
perhaps ill never know but I feel<br>
as if I live in it<br>
seeing but not feeling<br>
am I afraid to show<br>
my true feelings to even myself<br>
or do they not exist <br>
in this void I call<br>
purgatory</p>
